### Coding Journey
- Started 2016/2017 - First language Swift | 2nd language - HTML
I then took a big break, Didnt do much code from 2018 - 2020
In that time I pretty much forgot everything
I used to be pretty good with HTML, CSS, Javascrip and swift
Lockdown 2020 - Lots of free time so I restarted
