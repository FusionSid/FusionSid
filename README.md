### Favourite Projects:
- **[Why Bot](https://github.com/FusionSid/Why-Bot)**  
  Why bot is an open source, multi-purpose verified discord bot with over 100+ commands made to enhance your discord experience. This was my first major project and the one that really got me into programming. I started to rewrite it but lost motivation halfway through, however I believe that the [why bot rewrite code](https://github.com/FusionSid/Why-Bot/tree/rewrite-the-rewrite) is some of the best code i've ever written.

- **[SpaceFinder](https://github.com/Space-Finder/)**  
  SpaceFinder allows teachers to book their class locations more easily and allows the locations to be displayed on the school screens. This project was made for my school, and I worked with administration to create the project. I also got an NZQA technology scholarship/award for this project.

- **[ByteQuest](https://github.com/Byte-Quest-Website)**  
  A programming problem website (essentially like LeetCode) including a remote code execution engine to run code in a sandbox, and an online IDE including autocomplete and syntax highlighting.

- **[Password1](https://github.com/st22209/Password-Manager)**  
  An open-source, encrypted, safe and secure password manager to manage all your passwords in a secure place

- **[FusionSidAPI](https://github.com/FusionSid/FusionSidAPI)**  
  multi-purpose REST API that can do temporary file hosting, meme/image generation, text conversion, code execution and much more, I also make an API wrapper: [FusionSidAPI.py](https://github.com/FusionSid/FusionSidAPI.py) (DEPRECATED: needs to be updated to API v2)

- **[Untitled Chat](https://github.com/Untitled-Chat-App)**  
  An end-to-end encrypted chatting application I originally made for a school project.

- **[Reddit 2 Insta](https://github.com/FusionSid/Reddit2Insta-Meme-Uploader)**  
  Scrapes Reddit for memes and uploads them to [my instagram](https://www.instagram.com/never_gonnagive/)

### Languages I want to learn / am currently learning:

- C (& C++ because I may die of brain damage but at least my code will be **FAST AS FUCK**)
- Rust (Because rust 🦀 - everyone likes rust)
- Go, so I can make webservers with ALL the speed
- Basic Assembly (so I can finish my [programming language](https://github.com/FusionSid/Moyai-Lang) and make _RickRollOS™_)
