### Coding Journey
- Started 2016/2017 - First language HTML | 2nd language - Swift
I then took a big break, Didnt do much code from 2018 - 2020
In that time I pretty much forgot everything
I used to be pretty good with HTML, CSS, Javascript and ok with swift but now i can barely code a website without opening google 69 times and looking for help.
Lockdown 2020/21 - Lots of free time so I restarted my coding journey.
And since then ive been doing python cause its fun and im too lazy/scared to move on.
